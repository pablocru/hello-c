# Exercise 1: "Hello, World!" with a Twist

## Objective

Write a C program that prints the message "Hello, World!" to the screen. However, instead
of printing the entire message at once, print each character of the message one by one,
with a short delay (for example, half a second) between each character.

## Instructions

1. Use a loop to iterate through each character in the string "Hello, World!".
1. Print each character individually.
1. Use a function to introduce a delay between printing each character.
1. After the entire message is printed, the program should end.

## Example

If you run the program, the output should look something like this (with a small
pause between each character):

```txt
H
e
l
l
o
,

W
o
r
l
d
!
```
