# Exercise 2: Calculate the Sum of an Array

Write a C program that calculates the sum of all the elements in an array of integers. The
program should

1. Define an array of integers with at least 5 elements.
1. Use a for loop to iterate over the array and calculate the sum of its elements.
1. Print the sum at the end.

## Example

If the array contains the elements [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], the program should output:

```txt
The sum of the array elements is: 30
```
