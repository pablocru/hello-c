# Exercise 4: Reverse a String in place

Write a C program that takes a string and reverses its characters. The program should:

1. Define a function that takes a string as an argument and returns the reversed string.
1. Use a loop to reverse the string in place (i.e., without using an additional array).
1. The function should handle strings of varying lengths, including an empty string.

## Constraints

- You cannot use any built-in string functions like strrev (which is not standard in C).
- The function should work in place, meaning you should modify the original string rather
  than creating a new one.

## Example

For the string "hello", the program should output:

```txt
Original string: hello
Reversed string: olleh
```

For the string "world!", the program should output:

```txt
Original string: world!
Reversed string: !dlrow
```
