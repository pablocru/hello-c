# Understanding Pointers

Write a C program that:

1. Declares an integer variable x and initializes it to 100.
1. Declares a pointer ptr and assigns it the address of x.
1. Prints the value of x using the pointer ptr.
1. Changes the value of x to 200 using the pointer ptr.
1. Prints the updated value of x to confirm the change.

## Output Example

```txt
The value of x using the pointer is: 100
The updated value of x using the pointer is: 200
```
