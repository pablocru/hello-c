# Find the Largest Number in an Array

Write a C program that finds and prints the largest number in a given array of integers.
The program should:

1. Define an array with at least 10 integers.
1. Implement a function that takes this array and its size as parameters and returns the
   largest number.
1. Print the largest number to the console.

## Constraints

- Your function must work for any set of integers, not just the example provided.

## Example

For an array {4, 1, 7, 9, 2, 6, 8, 5, 3, 10}, the program should output:

```bash
The largest number is: 10
```
