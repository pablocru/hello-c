# Learning C for Fun

Welcome to my C programming journey! ðŸš€

I usually use high-level languages like Java, JavaScript, and Python. However, Iâ€™ve
decided to dive into C to deepen my understanding of programming fundamentals. Learning C
is not just about adding another language to my toolbox; it's about exploring the roots of
programming and understanding how things work under the hood.

## Why C?

C is a powerful language thatâ€™s closer to the hardware compared to the high-level
languages I usually work with. By learning C, I aim to get a better grasp of memory
management, pointers, and how programs execute at a lower level. Itâ€™s a great way to
appreciate the efficiency and performance aspects that higher-level languages often
abstract away.

## Whatâ€™s in this Repository?

This repository contains various exercises and challenges Iâ€™ve completed while learning C.
The exercises range from simple "Hello, World!" programs to more complex algorithms and
data structures. Each exercise is stored in its own directory, and Iâ€™ve included the
problem statements and my solutions.

### How the Exercises Were Created

I requested these exercises from ChatGPT by providing a specific prompt to generate a
series of progressive challenges, designed to take me from a beginner to an advanced level
in C programming. Hereâ€™s the prompt I used:

> "I am a software developer with knowledge in Java, JavaScript, and Python, among others,
> and I'm curious about low-level languages like C or Rust. Could you help me by creating
> a series of typical exercises that take me from zero to hero in C? Each statement should
> include examples to clarify any complex concepts. Remember, give me one at a time and
> only provide the solution when I explicitly ask for it."

### Example of an Exercise

Hereâ€™s an example of one of the exercises generated by ChatGPT:

> **Exercise 2: Calculate the Sum of an Array**
>
> Write a C program that calculates the sum of all the elements in an array of integers.
> The program should
>
> 1. Define an array of integers with at least 5 elements.
> 1. Use a for loop to iterate over the array and calculate the sum of its elements.
> 1. Print the sum at the end.
>
> **Example**
>
> If the array contains the elements [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], the program should output:
>
> ```txt
> The sum of the array elements is: 30
> ```

## Disclaimer

Iâ€™m learning C just for fun and to broaden my skills as a developer. Iâ€™m not currently
working on any C projects professionally, but I believe that understanding C will make me
a better programmer overall. If youâ€™re also learning C or just curious, feel free to
browse through the code!

If you notice any mistakes or have suggestions, Iâ€™m all ears! I appreciate any feedback so
don't hesitate to [open an Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/pablocru/hello-c/issues).

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
